# Replace a cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan

You can replace a cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan that is associated with a Global Accelerator \(GA\) instance. This allows you use the cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan that meets your requirements. The GA instance continues to forward network traffic when you replace the cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan.

The required cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan is purchased. For more information, see [Purchase a cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan](/intl.en-US/User Guide/Cross-border acceleration bandwidth plans/Purchase a cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan.md).

1.  Log on to the [Global Accelerator console](https://ga.console.aliyun.com/list).

2.  On the **Instances** page, find the GA instance that you want to manage and click the instance ID.

3.  On the page that appears, click the **Bandwidth Manage** tab.

4.  In the **Cross-region Bandwidth Package** section, find the cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan that you want to replace and click **Replace** in the **Actions** column of the plan.

5.  In the **Replace Cross-border Acceleration Bandwidth Plan** dialog box, select the cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan that you want to use and click **OK**.

    Only the cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan that is in the **Active** state can be selected.


After you replace the original cross-border acceleration bandwidth plan with the required bandwidth plan, the original one is disassociated from the GA instance and the required one is associated with the GA instance.
