    -   Each Global Acceleration instance is an independent resource under your account.

    You can bind a backend service to a Global Acceleration instance to accelerate the Internet access, and unbind that backend service whenever the Internet acceleration is no longer required.

-   Configurable network capabilities

    You can adjust the bandwidth of a Global Acceleration instances based on your business needs. Changes take effect in real time.

    -   The bandwidth range is 10-1000 Mbps. The maximum bandwidth that a Global Acceleration instance can use to access a backend service is 1000 Mbps and the minimum bandwidth is 10 Mbps. Contact your customer manager to apply for a larger bandwidth.

    -   If the bandwidth is between 10-100 Mbps, the gradient is 10 Mbps.

    -   If the bandwidth is larger than 100 Mbps, the gradient is 100 Mbps.
