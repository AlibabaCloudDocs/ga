# GA free trials

Alibaba Cloud Global Accelerator \(GA\) offers free trials.

## Applicants

The free-trials are available to only first-time users who have Alibaba Cloud accounts. The Alibaba Cloud accounts must pass real-name verification as enterprise identities.

**Note:**

-   First-time users are defined as users who are purchasing GA for the first time. The accounts of these users do not have pre-existing purchase or operation records. If a user has multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts, and one of the accounts has a purchase record, the user is not considered a first-time user. The Alibaba Cloud accounts must pass real-name verification as enterprise identities.
-   Each user is limited to one free trial. If a user has multiple Alibaba Cloud accounts, the user can choose only one account for the free trial. The Alibaba Cloud accounts must pass real-name verification as enterprise identities. Alibaba Cloud determines whether different Alibaba Cloud accounts belong to the same user based on the associated information when these accounts are created, logged on, and used. The associated information includes the identity number, phone number, payment account, device, and address shared by these accounts.
