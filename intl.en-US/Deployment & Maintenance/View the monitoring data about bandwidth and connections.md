# View the monitoring data about bandwidth and connections

Alibaba Cloud Cloud Monitor allows you to view the monitoring data of Global Accelerator \(GA\) instances, such as outbound and inbound bandwidth, outbound and inbound packet rate, outbound and inbound packet loss rate, and concurrent connections.

1.  Log on to the [Global Accelerator console](https://ga.console.aliyun.com/list).

2.  On the **Instances** page, find the GA instance that you want to monitor, and click the ![](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/7871827951/p76239.png) icon in the **Monitor** column.

    You can perform the following tasks to filter monitoring data by specifying the region, time period, start time, and end time.

    -   Click **Region**, and select a region from the drop-down list.
    -   Click **Time**, and select a time period from the drop-down list.
    -   Click the ![Start time and end time](https://static-aliyun-doc.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/en-US/9622274951/p77022.png) icon, and select the start time and the end time to customize a time range.
    The following table describes the monitoring metrics.

    |Monitoring metric|Description|
    |-----------------|-----------|
    |**Inbound Bandwidth**|The amount of data traffic that is received by the GA instance per second in the specified region.|
    |**Outbound Bandwidth**|The amount of data traffic that is sent by the GA instance per second in the specified region.|
    |**Concurrent Connections**|The total number of TCP and UDP connections that the GA instance has established in the specified region.|
